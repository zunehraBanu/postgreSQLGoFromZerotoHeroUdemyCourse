üìåWHERE keyword
-SELECT and WHERE are the most fundamental SQL statements and you will find yourself using them often!
-The WHERE statement allows us to specify conditions on columns for the rows to be returned. 
-basic syntax example:
SELECT column1,column2 FROM table where conditions;
-The WHERE clause appears immediate after the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.
-The conditions are used to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement.
-PostgreSQL provides a variety of standard operators to construct the conditions.

-Comparison Operators
     Compare a column value to something.
	‚ñ™Ô∏èIs the price greater than $3.00?
	‚ñ™Ô∏èIs the pet's name equal to "Sam:?
Examples:
SELECT name,choice FROM table
WHERE name='David';
SELECT name,choice FROM table
WHERE name='David' AND choice='Red' --AND is here so both the conditions should be true
Important:  the default behavior for string comparison in a WHERE clause is case-sensitive. This means that the condition WHERE name='David' will only match rows where the value of name is exactly 'David' with the same case.
